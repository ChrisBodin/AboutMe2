            <p class="content" >A little bit about me is that my name is Christopher and I am sixteen years old, 
              I like Math, Coding, and these things down below.

              <h4 id="Bowling"  class="header">Rock Climbing</h4>
              <p class="content" >Rock Climbing, specifically Bouldering is a hobby I enjoy because of the strength and puzzle aspects. 
                It is a sport in which you have a wall around 3-5 meters tall that you climb up to reach the top whether
                that is a top hold or the top of the wall. It is very fun because you need to figure out how to climb the route
                and then be strong enough, technically, physically, and mentally. It is very enjoyable and you can do it
                outside on rock faces or indoors in indoor gyms.</p>

              <h4 id="Gaming" class="header" >Bowling</h4>
              <p class="content" >Bowling to me is just overall enjoyable, I like practicing to become better at throwing strikes. It is fun
                to do with friends or alone. It is cool learning how to do special things like hooking the ball down the lane and what not. 
                Overall something I enjoy and something defining about me ish.

              <h4 id="Food" class="header" >Gaming</h4>
              <p class="content" >Gaming is something I have been doing my whole life pretty much. I enjoy it a lot and it helps you meet people
                and have fun overall. Right now I have been playing New World a lot and a little bit of Valorant. I PVP games a 
                decent amount but I have been getting into MMO's lately. But generally if a game is fun I can get into it especially
                if I play it with friends.

              <h4 class="header" >Food</h4>
              <p class="content" >Food is cool, thats pretty self explanatory. For me I enjoy good food but I like cooking more, I can get more enjoyment
                out of cooking for someone and having them enjoy the food than eating the food myself. I like learning new recipes and trying
                to master them, my favorite thing to cook is pizza and I have gotten pretty decent at it.
